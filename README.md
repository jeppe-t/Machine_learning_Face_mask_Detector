# Face Mask Detector.

I build this project in Python using machine learning. The purpose of this project is to predict if a person is wearing a facemask or not. The script uses ones build-in webcam, which will open up automatically, when the model is trained. You will be able to take a picture of yourself or another person, where the machine will predict if the person on the image is wearing a facemask or not. This prediction is not limited for COVID-mask, but generel facemask and can also detect on multiple faces on the image. Due to the size of this project I only uploaded the script and readme file, but there is a detailed description about how to setup the project, import the dataset and run this program below. One should carefully follow all the steps to ensure proper execution. 

## Steps to Setup

**1. Clone the application**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeppe-t/Machine_learning_Face_mask_Detector.git
```

**2. Start a new python project**
```bash
Go to your ide an create a new Python project. I recommend Pycharm or IntelliJ for this.
```

**3. Download dataset**

```bash
Go to kaggle and download this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset
(You might need to sign in using your google account or similar)
```

**4. Setup the project**

```bash
Go to kaggle and download this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset
(You might need to sign in using your google account or similar)
```

**4. Import libraries**

```bash
Go to kaggle and download this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset
(You might need to sign in using your google account or similar)
```

**5. Run the project**

```bash
Go to kaggle and download this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset
(You might need to sign in using your google account or similar)
```

The app will start running. Have patience - alot is happening and the model need some time to train.

When training is completed the model open your build-in webcam. 
Capture an image of a person with or without a mask.
Presse "q" to capture the image.

The camera will close down shortly after and the model will make a prediction.
